This is a series of analyses of data LiU exam data scraped (see scrape.py) from
[student.liu.se/tentaresult](http://www4.student.liu.se/tentaresult/).

The R code used to produce the graphs is not included, unfortunately, because I
created them all in the R REPL.  If you'd like verify my results, or do some
analysis yourself, you can either scrape the data with scrape.py, or use the
prescraped data in grades.csv, courses.csv and tests.csv
